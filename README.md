# Dorsly API

Dorsly was a reservation and pre-purchase web application with payment integrations handled through stripe. It was made as a school project; initially started as a theoretical application idea that eventually evolved to a full application.

This project was in development for roughly 2.5 years, and has been transfered though multiple repos as it transitioned from only front-end, to monorepo, and finally into two split repos for the Backend and Frontend.

The code quality is utter dogshit and we weren't aware of clean-code practices at the time of development, as we were still learning. Basically, the project was started while we had minimal knowledge in the field, and it was updated and evolved as we learned more and more about decent project structures. So the result is a project with a non-existing foundation of knowledge or reasoning, that had been built upon for years.
